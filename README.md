Kanna is a simple Discord chat bot that can learn from you and respond to you and your friends based on that.

## here is a quick guide:

`$teach`
learns a word from you, your first message will be the answer that kanna replies with. your second message will be the one which triggers kanna
(uppercase/lowercase is important)

`$delete`
deletes a reply (input the word that kanna replies with it)
(uppercase/lowercase is important)

`$fact`
returnes a random fact

`$weirdfact`
returnes a random weird fact, I dont recommend it 

`$help`
sends this guide


`$resetdatabase` , `$history` , and `$clearhistory` are admin-only commands. hopefully they will be avalible for server mods once database becomes exclusive for each server.
