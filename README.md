my second discord bot named Kanna

Kanna is my second text bot which is persian but it's easy to make it English or any other language.

Kanna is hosted on replit and uses replit database to store learned words also keep_alive.py is used to prevent replit server from entering sleep stage.
there are some built in words. they were the only words Kanna used to know before I added teach. $teach is used for teaching Kanna new words.
the words used to be stored in two dictianories but a week ago I added the functionality to store words in replit db as well so they don't disapear if the bot restarts.
$delete is the latest thing I added for deleting the learned words from both db and dictionaries but it doesn't work fine yet.
