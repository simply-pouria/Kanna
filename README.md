you can add kanna to your Discord server without a lot of premissions using this link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=868594950659506216&permissions=535310105664&scope=bot

Kanna is a simple Discord chat bot that can learn from you and respond to you and your friends based on that.

here is a quick guide:

$teach
learns a word from you, your first message will be the answer that kanna replies with and your second message will be the one which triggers kanna
(uppercase/lowercase is important)

$delete
deletes a reply (input the word that kanna replies with it)
(uppercase/lowercase is important)

$fact
returnes a random fact

$weirdfact
returnes a random weird fact, I dont recommend it 

$resetdatabase , $history , $clearhistory are bot admin-only commands hopefully they will be avalible for server admins once database became exclusive for each server.
