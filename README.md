Kanna is a simple Discord chat bot that can learn from you and respond to you and your friends based on that.

## Here is a quick guide:

`$teach`
> Learns a word from you, your first message will be the answer that kanna replies with. your second message will be the one which triggers kanna.
(uppercase/lowercase is important.)

`$delete`
> Deletes a reply (input the word that kanna replies with it)
(uppercase/lowercase is important.)

`$fact`
> Returnes a random fact.

`$weirdfact`
> ~~Returnes a random weird fact~~, I dont recommend it .

`$help`
> Sends this guide.


`$resetdatabase` , `$history` , and `$clearhistory` are admin-only commands. hopefully they will be avalible for server mods once database became exclusive for each server.
