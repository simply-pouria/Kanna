So let's say I measured the sky and I told you that the higher you go, the darker it got. So if the color of your sheets are light blue, you're in bloody trouble because it shows you aren't capable of handling what's dark. Because what is light blue is what you would see at the bottom of the sky which is the farthest point away from the top (aka that which is dark). So ok, what does that entail exactly? It means get out of your damn bed and buy black sheets because life is dark and there's nothing you can do about it except adopt responsibility by pursuing what is meaningful not what is expedient. If you can peer into the unknown or what would you call it.. um.. tapping into your unconscious as Jung calls it.. something like that.. and so then you're at least that much more competent than the guy next to you. And women like that, because you've established yourself higher within the dominance hierarchy. And one could say that's analagous to the fact that the chosen color of your sheets are placed higher up in the sky. Well... and that's what we've also found in lobsters, rats and monkeys is the data suggests it works in a similar way with humans! So it's like, get your act together and make a damn plan and make the first thing you do within that plan to be getting yourself some black bed sheets otherwise what the hell else are you going to do with your life man?", "masturbate": "Please DO NOT announce to the server when you are going to masturbate. This has been a reoccurring issue, and I\u2019m not sure why some people have such under developed social skills that they think that a server full of mostly male strangers would need to know that. No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five (especially considering where that hand has been). I don\u2019t want to add this to the rules, since it would be embarrassing for new users to see that we have a problem with this, but it is going to be enforced as a rule from now on.\n\nIf it occurs, you will be warned, then additional occurrences will be dealt with at the discretion of modstaff.
